# Log Analysis project for nano degree
## Gathering information from a simple database
### Developer: Nir Ganani

since this project was all about database,
I decided to do the heavy lifting in SQL, even
though it made more sense in some cases to to it
in python, to ensure, for example, that changing
from postgres to mysql will not require using
different string manupation functions and so on
